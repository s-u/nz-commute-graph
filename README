This repo contains a few scripts used to analyse commute patterns
in New Zeamand to generate a graph of transitions between
spatial polygons, in our case SA2s.

This README describes the whole process. For a quick start with just
the graph, look for `trans-matrix.rds` described at the bottom
which is all you need to construct the graph.

The country is divided into disjoint polygons: Statistical Areas (SAs).
The file `statistical-area-2-2021-clipped-generalised.shp`
has the polygons for level-2 statistical areas which is what we are
using here.

The original source is
  2018-census-main-means-of-travel-to-work-by-statistical-a.csv

https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/table/104720-2018-census-main-means-of-travel-to-work-by-statistical-area-2/

which lists pairs of areas and associated commuting counts by
various means of transport. We use a subset of that file which
only includes pairs where the SAs are not the same. The resulting
file is `transitions.rds`.

(-999 = NA or truncated 0)

We then take the endpoints from that data frame and
run a routing algorithm to compute the likely best route
between the two areas (home => work, taking centroids as
the routing way points). The result is in `routes-car.rds`.

It is a list with each entry corresponding to one row
in `transitions.rds`. Note that sometimes the routing can
fail, beause we use the SA centroid which may be too far
away from any road in some remote areas then the entry
is a string with the error.

Based on the routes, we compute the intersection of the
route with all SA2s and construct a sequence of SA2
along the route. There is some extra care to not flip-flop
when driving along the border of two SA2 (which is actually
common, because roads are often the boundaries).

The resulting sequence of SA2s for each route is in
`strings.rds`. The SA2s are identified by their index
in the shape file:

> s=readRDS("strings.rds")
> s[[1]]
[1] 615 598 597 601 604  19 618 617

From all the sequences plus counts from the census file
we construct a full transition matrix:

> m=readRDS("full-matrix.rds")
> dim(m)
[1] 476395      4
> m[1:10,]
      route from  to count
 [1,]     1  615 598    12
 [2,]     1  598 597    12
 [3,]     1  597 601    12
 [4,]     1  601 604    12
 [5,]     1  604  19    12
 [6,]     1   19 618    12
 [7,]     1  618 617    12
 [8,]     2   52  53    39
 [9,]     3  951 149    12
[10,]     3  149 949    12

Route is simply the index in the routes file (and thus
the `transitions.rds` data frame).

Finally, this huge matrix is aggregated down to individual
transitions between SA2: which is the final result
`trans-matrix.rds`:

> tm = readRDS("trans-matrix.rds")
> dim(tm)
[1] 7579    3
> tm[1:5,]
  from to count
1    2  1    12
2    3  1    45
3    4  1    69
4  262  1    45
5    1  2    57
> summary(tm$count)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    0.0    45.0   192.0   703.7   618.0 50214.0 

This matrix is quite small, because by definition you can only
transition to the neighboring SA2s.

Again the entry is simply the index into the shape file.

Known issues:
- the mapping from route points to SA2 sequence can skip an SA2
  if the route has no point in that SA2 (i.e. the road is straight
  across the entire SA2). We can detect this, because
  `int` (from "strings.R") will include the SA2, but it won't be in
  st_is_within_distance() point -> SA2 if there is no point inside
  or nearby. Therefore there can be transitions which are not
  into the neighboring SA2. Even if we detect it, fixing it is messy.
  Possibly the most simple would be to syntesize an intermediate point
  inside the missing SA2. One possible apporach would be to keep
  a neighbor list and if the target is not in the list, take the two
  points of the segment that crosses the border and generate an extra
  point in the middle. Note that it can still fail if such point
  happens to not be in any SA2 (e.g., the Harbour Bridge in Auckland
  if using clipped polygons).

- The routing is done using SA2 centroids. For some remote SA2 the
  centroid may be far away from any road and GraphHopper will fail.

- For historical reasons we are using 2021 SA2 even though this is
  2018 census. We should re-run with 2018 shape files.

Additonal info:

- The routes have both distance and duration which could be added
  to the mix if somehow useful.

- officially, -999 is "censored" wich means any number 0..5. We
  treat is as 0 since that's all we can do for all practical purposes.
